# OpenAI API Key Setup\n\nTo use the AI-powered quest generation feature, you need to add your OpenAI API key to the local.properties file:\n\n1. Open the local.properties file in the root directory of the project\n2. Add the following line (replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key):\n\n\\\\nopenai_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\\\\n\n3. Sync your project with Gradle files\n\nNote: The local.properties file is automatically excluded from version control by .gitignore, so your API key will remain private.
